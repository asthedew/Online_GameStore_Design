	I am very enjoying the fun of working on this project. Be honest, I have took the class of CS316 before, and I still confuse about the making website before I do this project. 
I just learn the making website of the fur. But for this project, I understood a lot of basic knowledges of how to make website and connect to database.
At the beginning of working on this project, I even hard to find the server to make my website working. I tried to use the server of VM, but I think it is so
inconvenient when I connect to database and change the table of database. So I searched the google to find the another way which is more convenience than using VM.
Then I found the xampp which contains the phpMyadmin and mysql. I took a long to time to learn how to use this program. For instance, how to create the new table 
in the phpMyadmin and how to insert the data into table. 
	I began to make the php file after all of preparatory work done. But some function of web ideas was so difficult to achieve when I really want to add those into my webpage.
For example, how to make the header and footer of web page unified. Or how to connect php files to database.
The more complicated problem was coming when solved those trouble.  In particular when I solved the shopping cart that how to check out when click the buybutton.
Then I tried to use the input hidden in the form to post array value to the page. Then i use foreach function to split them. But it may still have some bug in it.
	In fact, I think the most important thing that I am really exciting is I did a website by myself. even though this website is very simple, many problems or low end website.
But I have already known I need to practice over and over again. To practice can make the skill perfect.
